This project explores my daughter Arya's discovering the wonderful world of butterflies. While many butterflies were caught and released, we focused on 
the Monarch Butterfly. Through the website Whimsical Wings, we were able purchase and observed the staging of development for the butterfly.
This project was fun to make and we got to bond and learn something new.

The intended audience is anyone interested in learning more about the lifecycle and migration of butterflies. 

A lot of focus was placed on designing a uniform webpage that links both internal and external to provide information to the audience.
There is a total of four internal webpages. 
1) Index 2) Monarch Tales 3) Monarch Tails and 4) Feedback. The external website includes 1) https://monarchjointventure.org/monarch-biology/life-cycle 
2)https://whimsicalwingsfarms.com/about-whimsical-wings-butterfly-kits/ 3) https://maps.journeynorth.org/map

Unfortunately, there was no public APIs for anything related to butterflies. To include Arya's dad and to have a bit of fun, on the feedback page I linked
a dad jokes api found on https://rapidapi.com/hub.

The contact feedback form is utilizing https://smtpjs.com/ to send email encryption to my sheree.edmund1@gmail.com 
email address.
